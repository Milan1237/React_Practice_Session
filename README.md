Day 1:
I am creating a react project for the first time.

learnings :
Day 2:
1: Name the name of the file which returns a component with ".jsx"

2: Always try to name the file with capitalize form means the first letter of the file name should be Capital.

3: Always name the function in capitalize form means give the first letter of the function in Capital letter.

4: If any function is returned with html components then it should be imported with the given syntax : `import Demo  from './Custom.jsx'`. It means custom the function should be imported without curley brakets.
